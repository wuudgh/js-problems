# Problem Solving

This repo contains a number of problems for which you are required to provide:

1. An English explanation of the possible solution
2. A [pseudo code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) version of the solution
3. And finally, the javascript version of the solution

## Learning Objectives

+ To encourage you to think clearly about the problems you encounter
+ Enable you to turn plain English solutions into their Javascript equivalents

## Introduction

A general approach to problem solving is as follows:

1. Understand the problem
2. Draw experience from related problems to plan an approach to this problem
3. Try to solve the problem, based on 1. and 2.
4. Check your solution. Is it correct?

This repository requires you to use that approach.

## Exercise

This repo contains a number of problems. To solve the problems, do the following:

1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your machine
2. The problems are described in the [./src](./src) directory. They are nominally categorised as _easy_, _medium_, and _hard_.
    1. For each problem:
        1. Read a description of the problem in the file _problem.md_
        2. Add a plain English description of the proposed solution in the file _plain.md_
        3. Add a [pseudo code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) version of the plain English solution in the file _pseudo.md_
        4. Only after you've completed steps 2. and 3. should you attempt to code up a javascript solution in the file _solution.js_
            1. Your javascript should be in the form of a function that returns your solution
        5. Is your solution correct? If you're able, try checking your answer with different inputs

_Hint_: An example of a completed exercise is in the directory [src/easy/scores](src/easy/scores).
