# Pseudo Code Solution

To sum the numbers from 1 to 1000, i will first need a function and pass it a single argument.
Then within the function scope i create another variable with a value of 0.
After that i will need a need a for loop to go throuhg the numbers from 1 to 1000,
This means the loop begins at 1 and ends at 1000.
and add every number to the one next to it.
The variable with the value of 0 then will be given the total from all the numbers.
