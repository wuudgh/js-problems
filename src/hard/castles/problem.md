# Castles

Create a simple interactive adventure game. The adventure world consists of up to five castles each of which has up to seven rooms (35 total). Each room has a treasure, worth a certain number of points, and a creature guarding the treasure. The treasure can be captured by bluffing or fighting the creature. Bluffing always has a 30% chance of succeeding. The odds for winning a fight vary from creature to creature. The object of the game is to visit different rooms and gain as many treasure points as possible. The player begins with 9 lives and each fight lost costs a life. (There's no penalty for losing a bluff.) When all the lives (or all treasures) are gone the game ends.
