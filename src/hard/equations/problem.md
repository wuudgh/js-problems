# Equation solver

You are given a target number.

Using the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in that order (although, you may join digits together to form a bigger number), and the operations '+' and '-', you must find all possible equations that satisfy the target number.

Here is one of the equations for the target number 50:

`1 - 2 + 34 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 = 50`
