# Multiples of 3 or 5

There are three towers - the [Towers of Hanoi](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html). The objective of the game is to move all the disks over to tower #3, but you can't place a larger disk onto a smaller disk.

Given a number discs, find the minimum amount of steps needed to complete the game. For example:

```text
(3) ➞ 7
(5) ➞ 31
(0) ➞ 0
```

## Notes

+ The amount of discs is always a positive integer
+ 1 disc can be changed per move
