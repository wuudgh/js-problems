# Roman Numerals

Convert roman numerals into their arabic equivalent.

The "basic" roman symbols

I    X    C    M
1    10   100  1000

The "auxiliary" roman symbols

V    L    D
5    50   500

Convert the roman numeral to arabic processing the symbols from left to right according to the following rules:

1. A symbol following one of greater or equal value adds to its value. (E.g., XII = 12)
2. A symbol preceding one of greater value subtracts its value.(E.g., IV = 4; XL = 40)
